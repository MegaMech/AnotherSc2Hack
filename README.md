Compile notice:
---------------
When inspecting the source- code for the first time, make sure you compile the Project <b>at least</b><br>
three times in <i>Release</i> mode! This will make that the required libraries are compiled correctly.<br>
The Libraries "PredefinedTypes.dll" and "Plugininterface.dll" are required to compile successfully!<br>
<br>
Those Libraries will get compiled into <i>AnotherSc2Hack\bin\Release</i> and are statically linked to that path!<br>
When you change the binary output, make sure you change the project references as well!<br>

FAQ
---
<UL>
<li><b>What is this?</b><br>
		This is a tool to gather information from SC2's memory and draw overlays to display those information
		You gain a big advantage if used properly.<br>
		As Blizzard defines, it's a 3rd party tool therefore it's forbidden to use.<br>
		Using this tool can result in a ban from the Blizzard service "Starcraft II".<br>
		<b>USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK</b><br>
		<br>
<li><b>Why would you do it?</b><br>
		I'm just curious what can and can not be done. I like the interaction with SCII and the drawing/ 				formatting of the data.<br>
		Additionally, I want to exploit the way SCII is designed. SCII sends <i>all</i> data to all clients.<br>
		Maphacks are possible. Such models are totally outdated and should not be used anymore.<br>
		<br>
<li><b>What about fairplay?</b><br>
		Since <i>it is</i> possible to do the things I do, there can't be a 100% of fairplay. There will always be 			another person to publish hacks similar to this. The lack of fairplay is Blizzard's fault.
